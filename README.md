## Spatial Autocorrelation and partisan clusters in Texas

This repository contains the exam project for the Spatial Analytics course at Aarhus University conducted in the spring of 2022, as well as the data needed to recreate the results of this project.
The aim of the project was to investigate the spatial autocorrelation of Democratic votes in rural and urban areas in Texas during the 2016 Presidential election. 

## Content and repository structure
The election data needed to run this script was too large to upload to github directly, so to run the script you should download the ```TX_vtds``` data from https://openprecincts.org/tx/
For neatness' sake, this folder should be put into the ```data``` folder.
The ```src``` folder contains the markdown file ```Spatial_exam.rmd```. This should be all you need to run the script, as the rest of the data is acquired through the ```tigris``` package, which downloads shapefiles directly from the United States Census Bureau.
